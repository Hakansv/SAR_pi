SAR Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================

The purpose of this plugin is to provide Search and Rescue Patterns (SAR) plotting capability to OpenCPN.

The aims are to:

1. Generate GPX files for a number of SAR patterns
2. Plot selected SAR patterns directly in OpenCPN

Changelog
=========
Changes to version 1.1
- corrected Resque (FS#1446)
- fix bugs also present in route (error, double gpx)
- Update for O4.1
- Update translations

ToDo
=======
Once the Navobject becomes available to the plugin API, will update to also enable direct route plotting. 
Use coordinate input system from route_pi
Use route export into OCPN from route_pi
implement right click actions from route_pi

Compiling
=========
You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* git clone https://github.com/SaltyPaws/SAR_pi

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ../
* make
* sudo make install

You will have to place the folder "bitmaps" into your build directory to see the images. I have yet to embed these into the sourcecode.

Executables
